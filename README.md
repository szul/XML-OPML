# XML-OPML
Very old module (circa 2000-2004) from when blogrolls used OPML to describe their content.

This ancient code was developed as my first Perl module committed to CPAN.
It is outdated and no longer maintained, but shows an example of my early Perl experience, and first attempt at recursion.
